## User Story

I want to be able to find breweries in my city as well as learn the weather of the day.

## Acceptance Criteria

The Project is finished after the following:

1. A use-able API is found that will allow the developers to use it to find nearby breweries through in a city.
2. When the user inputs a US city it should populate with API data upon request.
3. Columns/Rows appear with various addresses, names and phone numbers of various breweries on them.
4. A Weather symbol of whatever city is searched appears on the top of the page.
